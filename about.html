    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <div class="about-content">
      <div class="about-text">
        <p>The History of Café Amora began with a simple dream: to create a warm, welcoming space where people can pause, connect, and enjoy good coffee and even better company. Founded in 2021 by a group of friends who shared a passion for food, design, and meaningful conversations, the cafe quickly became a beloved neighborhood spot. Starting with a small corner space and a handful of cozy chairs, we've grown into a cafe known for its homey atmosphere, artisanal brews, and heartfelt service. Every cup served at Café Amora carries a story — of friendship, community, and comfort.</p>
